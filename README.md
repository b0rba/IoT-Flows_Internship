# IoT-Flows_Internship

This application was required as part of the internship program process to the IoT-Flows project, more information about the project at: https://iot-flows.cin.ufpe.br/; The application itself is simple, we basically have to get a list in .JSON format from a url, make a search method and show the result of the search according to the previous input filter.

On the list view (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/), I saw as if there were 10 users, and each one of them "rented" 20 movies, and then through boolean we could know if they already watched the movie or not. None of this has been said and is not necessary for implementation, i did that for mere visualization of the project.

For some technical reasons the commits are not in chronological order, so i decided to commit the whole project at once, instead of creating a new project from the begginnig and start "all over again", that would be the right way to do it, but since the time is short I prefer not to risk it. The code is very straigthforward in case you are familiar with Android development.

Final comments (personal opinion): Before this project my experience in developing android was near nothing, I deciding to take a little longer to start coding the application itself so that I could learn the right way to implement it. StackOverflow was very important and I have to show a channel of a developer ( Derek Banas: https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas) that helped me a lot in the learning process so that I was able to do this application.
